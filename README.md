# InstantTwitch

A chrome extension build to replace the now broken and out dated [Twitch Now](https://github.com/Ndragomirov/twitch-now) extension. This extension tries to be minimal, while keeping all the features you expect (It's still in development so a lot of features are currently missing)

## Todo

- [x] Basic display of the currently live streamers
- [ ] Settings
- [ ] Lightmode
- [ ] Notifications
- [ ] Full Twitch search

## Building

You can build this extension with the command below, the extension is put into the `dist` folder from where it can be imported into chrome

```
npm run build
```
